      <h2>Ode to a Nightingale</h2>
      <p>by John Keats</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains my sense,
        <br />As though of hemlock I had drunk,
        <br />Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
        <br />One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk.
      </p>
      <p>
        O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
        <br />Cool&apos;d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
        <br />Tasting of Flora and the country green,
        <br />Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
      </p>
      <p>
        Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
        <br />Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
        <br />But on the viewless wings of Poesy.
      </p>
    </div>
